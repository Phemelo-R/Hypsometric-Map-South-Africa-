🌍*Hypsometric Map of South Africa*

This map visualizes South Africa’s elevation alongside key geographic and oceanographic features. It highlights:
🗻 Major mountain ranges (Drakensberg, Swartberg, Cederberg, Cape Fold Belt, and Magaliesberg)
🌊 Ocean currents (Benguela Current in the Atlantic & Agulhas Current in the Indian Ocean)
📍 Key oceanographic regions (Agulhas Bank & Benguela Upwelling)
🔵 Major rivers flowing through the landscape
🗻 The Great Escarpment of South Africa

I made the map using R🧑‍💻👾 and used some powerful R packages to download and visualize Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and river data:

rnaturalearth & rnaturalearthhires: For accessing South Africa’s geographical data and river data.
elevatr: To download elevation data and create a hillshade.
ggplot2: For creating the beautiful visualization.
tidyverse: To create dataframes for geographic and oceanographic coordinates.

This project demonstrates the power of R for geospatial analysis and data visualization. I enjoyed working on this project.
